## v0.9.1.0 (2025-05-02)

Release v0.9.1.0

- Add library versions for ghc-9.6.7, ghc-9.12.1 and ghc-9.12.2

- Fix <https://github.com/gentoo-haskell/hackport/issues/134>

- Test with ghc-9.12 in GitHub CI

- Add support for "#hackport: external-depends: ..."

  This is intended for situations where a Haskell package depends on a
  non-Haskell executable (which does not have a canonical field in the
  .cabal file spec).

  Does not currently support flags or version ranges on the atoms. Does
  not support BDEPEND yet as this needs to be added to
  `Merge.Dependencies.EDep` (see <https://github.com/gentoo-haskell/hackport/issues/130>).

  Random example:

      #hackport: external-depends: rdepend:dev-db/postgresql,depend:app-misc/ca-certificates

## v0.9.0.0 (2024-12-02)

Release v0.9.0.0

- Migrate to cabal-3.10 branch. This introduces a dependency on
  `directory >=1.3.7.0`. This effectively means that, moving forward,
  >=dev-lang/ghc-9.4 is required for newer versions of hackport on
  Gentoo.

- Hackport now builds with ghc-9.10

## v0.8.5.2 (2024-12-01)

Release v0.8.5.2

- No longer display warning notification when there are no warnings

- Add detection for new GHC versions

    - 9.6.6, 9.8.2, 9.8.3, 9.8.4, 9.10.1

- More entries for resolving pkg-config strings to gentoo packages

- Remove autogenerated `Paths_Cabal` and `Paths_cabal_install` modules

## v0.8.5.1 (2023-02-14)

Release v0.8.5.1

- Fix bug where dependencies do not get a `:=` slot operator

- Improve `remote-id` generation for `metadata.xml` by adding some relevant
  repository types and removing irrelevant ones.

## v0.8.5.0 (2023-02-05)

Release v0.8.5.0

- Add a warning for when a particular component of a package is unbuildable
  for the automatically-chosen GHC version. This is upgraded to a fatal error
  if any of the libraries in the package are unbuildable. (This should help a
  bit to prevent #116 from biting people).

- Add support for USE flags when resolving 'pkgconfig' dependencies in cabal to 
  portage dependencies.

- Update supported GHC versions when resolving the minimal GHC required for a
  package:
    - Versions 8.10.6 and earlier were removed
    - Added 9.2.7, 9.2.8, 9.4.5, 9.4.6, 9.4.7, 9.4.8, 9.6.3, and 9.6.4

  (Not defaulting to very old GHC versions will help avoid #116 as well).

- Stop adding special slot numbers to `dev-haskell/quickcheck` and 
  `dev-haskell/hdbd`. The functionality for adding special slot numbers for
  packages was scrapped.

  (See: https://github.com/gentoo-haskell/gentoo-haskell/issues/1502)

- Update bundled `hackage-security` to newer commit.

## v0.8.4.0 (2023-06-03)

Release v0.8.4.0

- Do not add `[profile]` to dev-lang/ghc

  The needed changes have been addressed in haskell-cabal.eclass and
  should not be handled by hackport

- KEYWORDs are now automatically passed forward between version bumps

  This functionality was removed in the last version and has been added
  back. Any "stable" keywords should automatically become "testing"
  when passed forward.

- Add shell completion functionality

  Use optparse-applicative's functionality to generate bash, zsh, and
  fish completion scripts. Because autocompletion for `hackport merge`
  requires searching the list of package/version strings from Hackage,
  this data is stored in a trie which is cached in
  ~/.hackport/packages.cache (which is removed when `hackport update`
  is run).

- Fix doctests

  Doctests should now work with cabal-v1 (Setup.hs), cabal-v2, and
  GitHub CI setups.

## v0.8.3.0 (2023-05-06)

Release v0.8.3.0

- Add `[profile?]` by default to dev-lang/ghc in RDEPEND

  Packages that require profiling and depend on the 'base' library
  (e.g. all of them) will need USE=profile on ghc.

- Only add current ARCH to KEYWORDS

  No longer pass KEYWORDS forward from previous ebuilds. Only add
  current ARCH by default.

## v0.8.2.2 (2023-04-29)

v0.8.2.2

Set modern defaults for LocalInfo in Portage.Host (this will help in
the event that askPortageq fails, such as on a clean stage3 chroot)

## v0.8.2.1 (2023-04-02)

v0.8.2.1

Allow Setup.hs to work without cabal-doctest

## v0.8.2.0 (2023-03-03)

v0.8.2.0

Update GHCCore dependency list:

- Mark 'stm' as non-upgradeable, 'parsec' and 'text' as upgradeable
- Update bundled version of 'process'
- Add `ghc-9.2.*` entries
- Remove ancient `<ghc-8.8` entries

## v0.8.1.0 (2023-02-16)

v0.8.1.0

- Revert change that adds dev-haskell/process to ebuilds

## v0.8.0.0 (2022-12-25)

v0.8.0.0

- Switch 'cabal' submodule to new 3.8 branch
- Use new updateAction from cabal-install
- Builds on ghc-9.2
- Make process an upgradeable package

## v0.7 (2021-07-10)

release 0.7

## v0.6.7 (2020-12-18)

release v0.6.7

## v0.6.6 (2020-07-27)

Release v0.6.6

Changes:

* Add `Hspec` test suite, migrating older `HUnit` tests to `Hspec`.

  There are currently 55 tests validating parsers, `metadata.xml`
  generators, licence converters and more to mitigate against
  unintended regressions

* Add `doctest` test suite to validate code comments.

  Although hackport is not a library, code comments are still
  important. Where we have code examples, let's make sure they are
  correct

* Comment the code in many places

* Refactor code, such as splitting `Merge.hs` between itself and
  `Merge/Utils.hs`, applying some hlint suggestions, and addressing
  some compiler warnings

* Fix a bug in the `Suffix` parser

* Raise `base` lower bound to 4.9 (hackport has not been able to build
  on `base-4.8` for many versions)

* Add GitHub CI for the GHC versions 8.0 -> 8.10 inclusive

* Set licence to GPL-3 in `.cabal` file, which it always was

* Rebase onto `Cabal-3.4` and `hackage-security-0.6.0.1` submodules

* Improve licence handling to more accurately generate the correct
  licence string where possible. This also fixes a regression which
  snuck in after a previous `Cabal` submodule upgrade, which would
  generate invalid GPL licence strings if the package's `.cabal` file
  used a `SPDX` licence identifier such as `GPL-<v>-or-later`

* Automate the addition of new USE flags into an existing
  `metadata.xml`.

  This new functionality alerts the user to the new `USE` flags (if
  any), and overwrites the existing `metadata.xml` with the union of
  the existing and new `USE` flags. This also updates any `USE` flag
  descriptions, as well as any other updated `metadata.xml` elements

* Add `GHC-8.8.4` library detection.
